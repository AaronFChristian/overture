## D-0001 — uv over pip/poetry for dependency management

Date: 2026-08-21 · Session 1 · Status: accepted

Context:  Needed a Python package/env manager for a project that will
          later run in CI, in Docker, and on Azure Container Apps.
Decision: Use uv for venv creation, dependency resolution, and running
          commands (`uv run pytest`, etc).
Why:      Single tool for venv + install + lockfile, notably faster
          resolution than pip, and has first-class GitHub Actions
          support (astral-sh/setup-uv) so local and CI environments
          are guaranteed identical. Already the standard in prior
          projects.
Rejected: Poetry (heavier, slower resolver, no real speed advantage
          for a project this size). Bare pip + requirements.txt (no
          lockfile discipline).
Revisit:  Not expected to change.

## D-0002 — pydantic-settings as the single config source

Date: 2026-08-21 · Session 1 · Status: accepted

Context:  Every component (DB, LLM provider, later Azure services)
          needs config values from environment variables.
Decision: One `Settings` class in `config.py`, read via a cached
          `get_settings()`. Nothing else calls `os.environ` directly.
Why:      Validates types and required fields at process startup, not
          three requests in. A missing DATABASE_URL fails loudly on
          boot instead of surfacing as a confusing runtime error later.
          Also gives autocomplete/type-checking on every setting.
Rejected: Bare `os.environ.get()` scattered through the codebase —
          this is exactly the anti-pattern that caused the
          "load_dotenv() must be explicitly called" bug class in
          prior projects; centralizing removes the whole failure mode.
Revisit:  When Azure Key Vault integration lands, Settings gains a
          secrets-provider layer — same class, new source.

## D-0003 — health endpoint has no DB dependency yet

Date: 2026-08-21 · Session 1 · Status: accepted

Context:  First route in the app; database layer doesn't exist until
          session 2.
Decision: `/health` returns a static 200 with no downstream check.
Why:      Once Postgres is wired in, this will split into liveness
          (process is up) vs readiness (process can reach the DB) —
          conflating them means a container orchestrator restarts a
          perfectly healthy process just because Postgres had a
          momentary blip. Keeping /health dumb now avoids having to
          unwind that conflation later.
Rejected: Adding a DB ping now — premature, and there's no DB
          connection code to ping yet.
Revisit:  Session 2, when the DB layer lands. Split into /health/live
          and /health/ready at that point.

## D-0004 — pgvector/pgvector Docker image over vanilla postgres + manual extension install

Date: 2026-08-21 · Session 1 · Status: accepted

Context:  Local dev needs Postgres with the pgvector extension
          available for later embedding storage (session 6).
Decision: Use `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` as the Compose image.
Why:      Ships the extension pre-built; `CREATE EXTENSION vector`
          just works. Avoids a manual apt-get/compile step inside a
          vanilla postgres image, which is a common source of
          "works on my machine" drift.
Rejected: `postgres:16` + manual extension build in a custom
          Dockerfile — more moving parts for no benefit at this stage.
Revisit:  Not expected to change through local dev. Azure Postgres
          Flexible Server also supports pgvector natively, so this
          carries forward to session 7 without a swap.

## D-0005 — Requirement.source_span is required, not optional

Date: 2026-08-22 · Session 2 · Status: accepted

Context:  The extraction graph (session 3) pulls pains, constraints,
          and requirements out of unstructured transcripts. A
          hallucinated requirement — one the model invented rather
          than found in the transcript — is the single most damaging
          failure mode for this project, since Overture's whole pitch
          is "traceable to what the prospect actually said."
Decision: `source_span: SourceSpan` on the Requirement schema has no
          default and is not `| None`. Pydantic rejects construction
          without it.
Why:      Enforcing this at the type level means the extraction graph
          physically cannot produce a Requirement without a span — a
          node that tries just gets a ValidationError, not a
          requirement that silently ships without provenance. A
          runtime check ("if not span: drop it") is the same rule
          enforced by convention instead of by the type checker, and
          conventions get skipped under deadline pressure.
Rejected: `source_span: SourceSpan | None = None` with a downstream
          filter step — tested this mentally and rejected it: it
          means bad data can exist as a valid Requirement object for
          however long it takes to reach the filter, which is exactly
          the gap a bug hides in.
Revisit:  Not expected to change. If a future requirement type
          genuinely has no single traceable span (e.g. an inferred
          requirement synthesized from multiple pains), that needs a
          new schema, not a loosened constraint on this one.

## D-0006 — Claude primary, Azure OpenAI swappable, behind one Protocol

Date: 2026-08-22 · Session 2 · Status: accepted

Context:  The report calls for Azure OpenAI Service as the deployment
          target. Aaron already has working Claude API access and
          usage patterns from prior projects.
Decision: `LLMProvider` is a `typing.Protocol` with one method,
          `complete()`. `AnthropicProvider` and `AzureOpenAIProvider`
          both implement it. `get_llm_provider()` reads
          `settings.llm_provider` and constructs the right one.
          Nothing outside `providers/` imports `anthropic` or `openai`
          directly.
Why:      Two concrete reasons, not just "abstraction is good
          practice." First, cost: local dev (sessions 1-6) runs
          entirely on Claude, so Azure OpenAI — which has no free
          tier at all — never gets touched until session 7-8, and
          even then only enough to prove the abstraction works.
          Second, positioning: a pluggable provider layer is itself
          evidence for the "designs for portability" argument this
          whole project exists to make, and it means the same
          codebase demos honestly to Microsoft (Azure OpenAI path)
          and to Anthropic/OpenAI (Claude path) without a rewrite.
Rejected: Azure-OpenAI-only — faster to build, but ties the whole
          project's LLM cost to a service with a meter running from
          the first token, and undercuts the FDE-facing pitch.
Revisit:  If a third provider is ever needed (e.g. for Crucible's
          multi-vendor comparison), it implements the same Protocol —
          no changes needed to this decision.

## D-0007 — Pydantic schemas and SQLAlchemy models share names, different modules

Date: 2026-08-22 · Session 2 · Status: accepted

Context:  Both the API-facing domain types (schemas.py) and the
          database tables (db/models.py) represent the same four
          concepts: DiscoverySession, Requirement, SolutionBrief,
          DemoConfig.
Decision: Same class names in both files. Callers import with a
          module prefix (`from overture.db import models` then
          `models.Requirement`) or an alias, never a bare
          `from overture.db.models import Requirement` alongside a
          bare `from overture.schemas import Requirement` in the same
          file.
Why:      The 1:1 correspondence between "what the API returns" and
          "what's in the database" is the whole point — matching
          names make that correspondence visible at a glance instead
          of requiring a mental lookup table (RequirementSchema maps
          to RequirementORM maps to... ). The cost is import
          discipline, which ruff's import-sorting already partially
          enforces.
Rejected: Suffixing one side (`RequirementORM`, `RequirementModel`) —
          rejected because it's asymmetric for no reason; neither
          side is more canonical than the other.
Revisit:  If this discipline gets violated in a later session (a bare
          double-import slips through), that's a signal to reconsider
          — not before.
